Basic stuff to make you up and running with localtunnel.me
Allows you to share externally any of your local sites, which are working on local server.

This config allows you to share any site which opens as a domain on your PC. For example, my-site.loc, which doesn't have explicit port.
Just edit the gulp file and run with "gulp".

Two main options are
    **proxy**: *"domain.loc"* 
    **tunnel**: *true*
proxy - is your site's local domain name; should be string
tunnel - true for auto generetaed prefixes on localtunnel.me service, or your prefixe in quotes.
